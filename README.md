# Access Control System (ACS) - Java Project

This Java project simulates an Access Control System (ACS) managing users, groups, areas, and door access. It was developed as part of a university software engineering course.

## ⚙️ Main Features

- User and group management
- Access control via doors and zones
- Simulated clock and timed actions
- Modular Java architecture

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java (JDK 8+)
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)
- Logback for logging

## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
  base/
    - Actions.java
    - Clock.java
    - DirectoryUsers.java
    ...
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Import the project into **IntelliJ IDEA** or another Java IDE.
2. Ensure dependencies (if any) are correctly set up.
3. Run the main simulation class (if applicable).

## 📄 Notes

- Project structure is based on packages in `/src/base/`
- Includes configuration file: `logback.xml`
- The code may require some class stubs to be completed depending on instructor requirements
